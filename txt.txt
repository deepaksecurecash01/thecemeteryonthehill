                  In 1840, the Horseshoe Section, No-orlunga Township, known
                  today as Old Noarlunga, was the first township to be
                  successfully established in the Noarlunga district. Early
                  settlers were composed of farmers, storekeepers, traders,
                  timber cutters, and tradesmen such as stonemasons, builders,
                  and carpenters. By the end of the year, the town had a hotel,
                  the Horseshoe Inn, and a store.

                  Year after year, despite the challenges in farming and the
                  economic depression, the colony had seen growth. In 1851, the
                  population had increased, with the addition of a new store and
                  hotel, a mill, a brewery, and a malthouse.

                  was laid in 1850 by Bishop Augustus Short, the first Church of
                  England Bishop in the colony. It was not until 1851 that The
                  Church was ready for services. It has had improvements over
                  the years, with the addition of a sanctuary, chancel, and a
                  vestry in 1903.

                  Hill was buried in the cemetery on the 21st of May 1866.
                  Richard and his family arrived in South Australia in 1848 and
                  built their family home in the colony. As one of the early
                  settlers, he also became a local councillor, a Justice of the
                  Peace, a lay reader, and a church warden. He died of cancer of
                  the bladder and mania. His wife, Mary, died on 31 May 1868
                  after sustaining serious injuries from a horse trap accident
                  and was buried in The Cemetery as well.

                  Another one of the early pioneering families in the colony was
                  the Holly family. Together with his wife and two children,
                  William Holly came to South Australia aboard the Apolline in
                  October 1840. He, later on, built a hotel and even donated Â£5
                  towards funds for the building of The Church and Cemetery on
                  the Hill. The Holly family had prospered in the emerging
                  colony and their children had married into the other pioneer
                  families. Although William Holly went back to England, his
                  children and their descendants lived their lives in the
                  district and were eventually buried in The Cemetery.

                  were recipients of the prestigious Medal of the Order of
                  Australia and others had served during the World Wars. Some of
                  the headstones found here are a testament to the craftsmanship
                  of the time. The intricate carving and details on these
                  headstones can still be admired in the Cemetery today.

                  After over 160 years, The Church and Cemetery on the Hill was
                  put on the market and is now under the care of the Bacchus
                  Family. The Cemetery was rebranded from St Philip and St James
                  to The Cemetery on The Hill when purchased in early 2020, this
                  was to recognise the separation of the Church and Cemetery
                  from the Anglican Church. We want to reassure that while the
                  name has changed, the history and origin of the Church and
