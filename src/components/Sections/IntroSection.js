          Perched on top of a hill overlooking the Onkaparinga River and the
          beautiful township of Old Noarlunga is The Church and Cemetery on the
          Hill. Formerly the Church and Cemetery of St Philip and St James,
          which was established in 1850 shortly after the first European
          settlement in the area around the 1840s. <br /> On the 25th of July
          1850, the land was conveyed in trust for erection and maintenance of a
          Church of England, with Richard Bosworth, James Clark, and Philip
          Hollins appointed as trustees. The Church and Cemeteryâ€™s former name,
          St Philip & St James, was in honour of Mssrs Clark and Hollins.
